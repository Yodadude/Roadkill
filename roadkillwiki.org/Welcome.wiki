Roadkill .NET wiki engine is a lightweight but powerful Wiki engine built on the following foundations:

* .NET 4.0
* jQuery
* ASP.NET MVC 3 with Razor
* NHibernate
* Creole Wiki syntax (plus Mediawiki and Markdown)
* SQL Server (although it supports mySQL, SQlite, DB2...anything that NHibernate supports, except Oracle)

It's themeable, well documented, supports Active Directory authentication and is extremely easy to use. It's also Open Source and free - licensed under the [[http://roadkill.codeplex.com/license|MS-PL license.]]
